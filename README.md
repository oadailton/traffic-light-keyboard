# Traffic Light Keyboard

Have you ever considered turning your keyboard into an authentic traffic light? This is my first project in Python.

## Installing dependencies

```cmd
pip install cfonts
pip install pywin32
```

## Running

```cmd
python traffic-light-keyboard.py
```

## Traffic Light Modes and duration

"For now, we have created two operating modes for the traffic light. The first mode (0) allows the traffic light to function normally, following the user-defined times for how long it stays green or red. The user can choose a time between 5-90 seconds for each. The other mode is the flashing yellow mode (1), where the traffic light continuously blinks in yellow."
